# My "more doing" Site!:

Nothing much here, only learning the basics of creating a website in accordance to the Kodilla course.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Fisrt of all download or clone the files to Your pc.

### Prerequisites

Install flask, if You don't have it (yet, if You are here on GitHub i guess You already have it ;))

```
>pip install Flask
```

### Turn on Flask on cmd

In the app.py directory type in
```
>flask run
```
Thanks to that we can call out my website in a browser.

## Lets check it out!

Once flask is running on cmd, open any browser you usually use and type in:
```
localhost:5000/kantor
```
And there You go. The GREAT **Echange currency** site!! Pretty nice. 
The data is downloaded from the bank everytime the site is chosen. In the select part You may choose one of the following currencies:
```
USD
AUD
CAD
EUR
HUF
CHF
GBP
JPY
CZK
DKK
NOK
SEK
XDR
```
Later type in how much would You like to buy of the choosen currency and the click "**Calculate**"
Here we go. How much Polish LN's you need to pay to get that much amount of money, of your desired currency.

## But why?

These are my first steps in creating websites and try to understand the HTML Methods like GET and POST. Also learn how to save and use files in json and bring up some more funcionality.
I won't be doining anything more here, later I'll present more sites like this. Well, maybe more complex. ;)
